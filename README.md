Python has many libraries for Deep Learning. The three most popular ones are TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Keras. Keras is the high-level API of the TensorFlow platform and it is probably the simplest and user-friendly out of these three. However, when it comes to complicated Deep Learning pipelines, Keras might not be sufficient. I find PyTorch the most universal among these tools.

Compared to TensorFlow, based on my observations, PyTorch is becoming a more frequent requirement for DS and MLE positions. Moreover, I see that many state of the art projects are written on PyTorch.

Compared to Keras, PyTorch gives more flexibility while working with neural networks. It is also faster, which is a huge advantage.

However, I am not saying that PyTorch is the best of these three tools. Each has its pros and cons, but I chose this framework for myself as the main one (while solving Deep Learning problems). That is why, in this repository I want to take a look at how it works, and what we can do using it.
